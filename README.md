# GPSvelo_KrigingInterp
Interpolation of GPS velocity using Kriging method
## Illustrations
third party toolbox：matlab_Kriging_toolbox (DACE)

main file: main_program_interp.m
## Example
I have provided the example input in the package as Mongolia_GPS.xlxs, which is the observations in Mongolia during 1997-2003 from Calais et al.（2003）, and results are as follows:

Black arrows are velocity after interpolation, while red arrows are observations.
## Contact
If you're using this library or have questions, let me know! I'm happy to work together on the code and its applications.
